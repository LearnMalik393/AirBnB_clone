The airBNB project is divided into 7 stages
the first stage is the console, this stae has to do with creating objects, serialising file and creating the first storage engine ; the file storage
the next stage is thE HTML, this is the structure of the web application, simple HTML pages
the third stage is the MySQL this is a database to store objects
the final stage is the deployment of HTML and put on a sever
the FLASk stage is integrating modules in storage with HTML
the sixth stage is the rest API taking the object and parsing in JSON
the last piece is web dynamic involves integrating HTML with the JSON

Description of the console 
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has 
a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which 
was developed with python OOP programming.

The available command are 
count
create
destroy
show
update

with these commands we can interact with our application backend and perform operations like  

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object
